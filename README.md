# boosted-charts

Visual analysis of boosted exports

## About

WIP, parsing is done but charts are still missing.

A friend and I both use [Boosted](https://www.boostedproductivity.com/) to track
the time we spend on each university subject. Even tough the app is amazing to
track time and even for most statistics, we thought that the analysis can be
improved.

## Build it

You need to install node and npm.

```
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run build   # Compile TypeScript
```
