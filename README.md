## About

A friend and I both use [Boosted](https://www.boostedproductivity.com/) to track
the time we spend on each university subject. Even tough the app is amazing to
track time and even for most statistics, we thought that the analysis can be
improved.

## Build it yourself

You need to install node and npm.

```
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run build   # Compile TypeScript
```
Now you can open `index.html` in your browser
